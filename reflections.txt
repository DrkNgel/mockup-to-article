Your response goes here!
I learned how to put a text in bold and italic using <b> and <i> or <strong> and <em>.
I also learned how to strike through a text using <strike> and hw to create an horizontal rule using <hr>.
Most of it was quite easy.
The most difficult or tricky part was to align all the text with the picture
<figure> is great to align a text to an image. To do so, all the text has to be between <figure> and </figure>, even if there is text above the picture that need to be aligned.
